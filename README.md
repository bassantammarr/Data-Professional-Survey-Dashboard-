# Data-Professional-Survey-Dashboard

## This project is based on a real survey dataset about data professionals.
I performed data cleaning and transformation using Power BI, then created an interactive dashboard to visualize insights about:

- Demographics (gender, country, job title)

- Average salaries and job satisfaction

- Learning opportunities, work–life balance, and salary happiness

The dashboard provides a clear overview of trends and satisfaction levels among data professionals in the industry.
